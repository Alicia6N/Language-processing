# Language Processing
Techniques and tools for the design of compilers and others tools for structured text processing following a given language.
## Projects
### 1. Recursive descent parser.   ### 
The project is to implement a recursive descending parser using Java as the source language. As a subprogram of the parser it would be necessary to carry out a lexical analyzer.
### 2. SLR parser.   ###
The project is to design an ascent parser, using the analysis algorithm by a shift-reduce technique, and building the tables with the SLR method.
### 3. Recursive descent translator.   ###
This project is to implement a recursive descent translator based on _Project 1_, which translates from the source language (similar to Pascal) to a language similar to C, using Java as the source language.
### 4. Ascent parser using bison and flex.  ###
This project is to implement an ascent translator using  **bison** and **flex** tools, modern versions of yacc and lex, for the same translation process of _Project 3_.
